Dashboards are great for visually representing various data sources, giving a summary, or answering a specific question.

Many packages for Dashboards are enterprise software - not ideal if learning at home. Among free options, the Dash package for Python is a good place to start, as it has an open-source version and good documentation.

I've now [completed](https://cormackinsella.github.io/certs) the LinkedIn Learning course in Dash. Much of the code is on my [GitHub](https://github.com/CormacKinsella/python-data-science). I've also been playing with deployment of Dash apps to cloud service providers, with a hello world example [here on Render](https://dash-cloud-aa2t.onrender.com).
