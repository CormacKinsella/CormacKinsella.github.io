The time has finally come, my PhD thesis is finished and printed! The electronic copy is [available here](https://hdl.handle.net/11245.1/1aceb7bf-ccb3-49ef-8ce5-31db8358545a).

I owe a huge thanks to Dr. Lia van der Hoek, my PhD promoter. Lia won EU financing for the HONOURs Marie Sk≈Çodowska-Curie Action training network, which funded 15 early stage researchers in PhD positions across Europe. She entrusted one of these to me, and we've had a great time over the years since.

I think the aspect I appreciate most about the resulting thesis is that the research direction was never planned - our studies into ssDNA viruses and their hosts came about by chance discoveries, actively pursued.
