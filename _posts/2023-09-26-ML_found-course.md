Machine learning models and algorithms are integral tools in almost any modern company or research field, and having an ML skillset is thus increasingly in demand. With that said, not only is the field amazingly diverse, it is accelerating rapidly, and getting into the topic can be daunting.

I had a professional interest in ML during my PhD, using tools such as AlphaFold and playing around with various predictive algorithms, though I never directly developed ML models. It is therefore time to address that, starting with some foundational training.

I've [now finished](https://cormackinsella.github.io/certs) a LinkedIn Learning course in ML foundations with Python. The code is on my [GitHub](https://github.com/CormacKinsella/python-data-science), where I will be adding further material over time.
