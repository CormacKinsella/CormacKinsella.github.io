#### <center> Circos, from [Nature Communications, 2020](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-18474-w) </center>

![The image shows alignments between multiple contigs, visualised with the program Circos](https://CormacKinsella.github.io/assets/img/data_vis-treebeard-circos.png "Circos for visualising complex features and multiple alignments")

>Visualising complex features and "all versus all" alignments. Here, showing sequence identity between virus genes and endogenous viral element regions in parasite genomes.

<br/>

#### <center> Alphafold & Mol*, from [PNAS, 2023](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2303844120) </center>

![The image shows protein structures, predicted by Alphafold, visualised with the program Mol*](https://CormacKinsella.github.io/assets/img/data_vis-PNAS_alphafold.png "Alphafold protein/domain structure analysis")

>Alphafold in combination with Mol* for protein domain analysis. Here, exploring predicted monomer and multimer structure of proteins involved with single-stranded DNA replication.

<br/>

#### <center> Gene ontology enrichment, from [Nature Communications, 2019](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-019-13427-4) </center>

![Alt text](https://CormacKinsella.github.io/assets/img/data_vis-GRC-GO-enrichment.png "Gene ontology enrichment on the zebra finch germline-restricted chromosome")

>Genes identified on the songbird germline-restricted chromosome (GRC) were subjected to GO term enrichment analysis, motivated by the unknown role of the GRC and its unusual genetic features.

<br/>

#### <center> Phylogeny, from MSc thesis (Uppsala University) </center>

![Alt text](https://CormacKinsella.github.io/assets/img/data_vis-UU-thesis-GRC_27L4.jpg "Divergent paralogs within a single zebra finch individual")

>Phylogenetic analysis, here exploring paralogs within a single individual - one somatic sample (liver), and one germline (testis). The results are explained by the presence of a GRC in the germline sample.

<br/>

#### <center> Genome synteny, from [PNAS, 2023](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2303844120) </center>

![Alt text](https://CormacKinsella.github.io/assets/img/data_vis-Draup-genome-synteny.png "text")

>Genome synteny analysis, here examining diverse avipoxvirus representatives to understand horizontal-gene transfer from ssDNA viruses to poxes.
